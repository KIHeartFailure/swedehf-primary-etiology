# Data

## Data sources

The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) is an ongoing nationwide quality registry started in 2000, 
that includes in- and out-hospital patients with HF, regardless of EF and previous history of HF[@swedehf]. 
Around 80 variables are recorded at 
discharge from hospital or at the outpatient visit, i.e. index date, and 
entered into an electronic database managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research 
Center (Uppsala, Sweden). Up to April 2017 the only inclusion criterion was a 
clinical diagnosis of HF, which was thereafter defined according to the ICD-10 
codes I50.0, I50.1, I50.9, I42.0, I42.6, I42.7, I25.5, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2. 
In 2023, 69 of 76 Swedish hospitals enrolled patients in SwedeHF, which had a 59% coverage of the prevalent HF population in Sweden[@annualreport]. 

SwedeHF was linked with national Swedish registries (SHFDB v 4.2.1) through the 
Swedish personal identity number (PIN)[@pin]: 

- The National Patient Register (The National Board of Health and Welfare) for 
additional comorbidities and the hospitalization outcomes
- The Cause of Death Register[@dors] (The National Board of Health and Welfare) for outcomes 
death
- Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA)[@lisa] 
and the Register of the Total Population (Statistics Sweden) for socio-economic factors

## Acknowledgments

Please include "We thank all staff members at care units reporting into the SwedeHF registry for their contribution."

## Ethics and Informed consent

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 2021-04326. 
Individual consent was not required, but patients were informed of entry into SwedeHF and able to opt‐out.

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

```{r}
#| label: tbl-flow
#| tbl-cap: Information for flowchart
default_kable(flow) %>%
  row_spec(c(1, 11), bold = T)
```

First patient in: `r min(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)` and last patient in: `r max(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)` 
from approximately `r rsdata %>% distinct(shf_centre) %>% count() %>% pull(n)` enrolling centers. 

## Definitions

### Primary etiology

In the SwedeHF CRF primary etiology is recorded in the following categories: 
DCM, Heart valve disease, Hypertension, IHD, Known alcoholic cardiomyopathy, Other. 
For this project DCM, Known alcoholic cardiomyopathy and Other were categorized as Other. 
Baseline characteristics and trends over time are however presetned for the original 6 categories. 

### EF

EF subgroups are defined as HFrEF (LVEF <40%), HFrEF (LVEF 40-49%) and HFpEF (LVEF $\geq$ 50%).

### Sex

All analyses were performed overall and also in men and women separately.

# Statistical analysis 

## General

All analyses were performed using `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string` [@r]. 
The level of significance is set to 5%, two-sided. No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons were made and therefore the results should be viewed with care.

## Missing data

Missing data was imputed with multiple imputation (n = 10) using mice [@mice] and Rubin’s rules was used for combining estimates and standard errors across imputed data sets. 
Variables included in the model are indicated in @tbl-base. Primary etiology was not included in the model. 
The primary outcome, `r outvars %>% filter(primary) %>% pull(name)`, was included as the Nelson-Aalen estimator.

## Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics are presented by primary etiology. 
Categorical variables are presented with n and percentage and tested for 
differences between groups with the chi-square test. 
Continuous variables are presented with median [first quartile-third quartile] and tested for 
differences between groups with the Kruskal-Wallis test. 

Separate analyses were further performed for the respective EF groups and by sex. 

## Associations between primary etiology and EF

The association between primary etiology and EF (EF as dependent variable) was evaluated using a multivariable multinominal regression 
including the variables indicated in @tbl-base. The variables were selected based on clinical relevance. 

### Assumptions

Possible outliers were evaluated using Cook's distance and multicollinearity was 
evaluated using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). 

## Association between outcomes and primary etiology across EF

The following outcomes are considered: 

- `r paste0(outvars$name[1], " (", outvars$shortname[1], ") (primary outcome)")`
- `r paste0(outvars$name[2], " (", outvars$shortname[2], ")")`
- `r paste0(outvars$name[3], " (", outvars$shortname[3], ")")`

Time to first events were presented with cumulative incidence curves by primary etiology separately for the respective EF groups. 

Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to model the time to first 
event including primary etiology, EF and the interaction between the two thereby rendering 
the interpretation of the association between primary etiology and outcomes in EF subgroups 
and at the same time testing for differences in the association between EF groups. 
Adjustment was performed for variables indicated in @tbl-base. 

Data were censored at 2023-12-31, emigration from Sweden or, for HFH, at death. 

### Assumptions

The proportional hazards assumption was investigated using the scaled Schoenfeld 
residuals leading to that `r paste0(stratavars, collapse = ", ")` were stratified for in the models. 
Possible outliers were visually inspected by plotting the dfbetas. 

# Results

```{r}
med <- rsdata %>%
  summarise(
    med = fn(median(shf_age), dig = 0),
    q1 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.25), dig = 0),
    q3 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.75), dig = 0)
  ) %>%
  mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", q1, "-", q3, ")")) %>%
  pull(out)

percfem <- rsdata %>%
  count(shf_sex) %>%
  mutate(perc = fn(n / sum(n) * 100, 0)) %>%
  filter(shf_sex == "Female") %>%
  pull(perc)
```

The median (q1-q3) age is `r med` and `r percfem`% females.

  summarise(
    med = fn(median(sos_outtime_death / 365.25), dig = 1),
    min = fn(min(sos_outtime_death / 365.25), dig = 1),
    max = fn(max(sos_outtime_death / 365.25), dig = 1)
  ) %>%
  mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", min, "-", max, ")")) %>%
  pull(out)

sumsurv <- rsdata %>%
  summarise(sumpy = fn(sum(sos_outtime_death) / 365.25, dig = 0)) %>%
  pull(sumpy)
```

The median (min-max) follow-up is 
`r medsurv` years for a total of `r sumsurv` patient-years of follow-up.
